# My Coding Journey

## Why I'm Here
I'm tired of copying code without understanding. I want to build real things and understand every single character I type.

## What I'm Learning
- [ ] Python fundamentals (but actually understanding them)
- [ ] How to think like a programmer, not a copy-paster
- [ ] Building tools for my PhD research
